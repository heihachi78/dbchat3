#### Constraints and Rules

| Constraint | Business Justification |
| --- | --- |
| **NOLOGGING** | Prevents logging of index updates, which can reduce the overhead of maintaining the index. This is suitable for read-heavy workloads where indexing is used primarily for filtering. |
| **NOCOMPRESS** | Disables compression of the index, which can improve performance in certain scenarios. However, it may result in increased storage requirements. |
| **NOPARALLEL** | Prevents parallel processing of index updates, which can reduce the overhead of maintaining the index. This is suitable for small to medium-sized indexes where parallel processing would not provide significant benefits. |

### Component Analysis (Leverage ALL DDL Comments)

*   The `NOLOGGING` property indicates that logging of index updates will be disabled.
*   The `NOCOMPRESS` property disables compression of the index, which may result in increased storage requirements.
*   The `NOPARALLEL` property prevents parallel processing of index updates.
