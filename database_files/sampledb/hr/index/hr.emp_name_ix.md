**HR.EMPLOYEES Index: HR.EMP_NAME_IX**
=====================================

### Overview
----------------

The `HR.EMP_NAME_IX` index is a non-clustered index created on the `HR.EMPLOYEES` table to improve query performance on columns `LAST_NAME` and `FIRST_NAME`. This index is used for efficient retrieval of employees based on their last name and first name.

### Detailed Structure & Components
-----------------------------------

#### Columns Covered

*   `LAST_NAME`: Ascending order
*   `FIRST_NAME`: Ascending order

#### Index Type

*   **Index Name:** HR.EMP_NAME_IX
*   **Index Type:** Non-Clustered Index
*   **Columns Covered:** LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME
*   **Index Order:** Ascending (LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME)

#### Performance Impact

*   The `NOLOGGING` clause indicates that the index will not be logged to disk during write operations.
*   The `NOCOMPRESS` clause indicates that the index will not be compressed.
*   The `NOPARALLEL` clause indicates that the index will not be created in parallel.

#### Business Logic and Constraints

*   This index is used to support efficient retrieval of employees based on their last name and first name. It can be used in queries such as:
    ```sql
SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE LAST_NAME = 'Smith' AND FIRST_NAME = 'John';
```
*   The `ASC` keyword indicates that the index is ordered in ascending order.

### Comprehensive Constraints & Rules
-----------------------------------

*   The index is created to support efficient retrieval of employees.
*   The `NOLOGGING` clause indicates that the index will not be logged to disk during write operations.
*   The `NOCOMPRESS` clause indicates that the index will not be compressed.
*   The `NOPARALLEL` clause indicates that the index will not be created in parallel.

### Usage Patterns & Integration
------------------------------

This index can be used in conjunction with queries that reference the `HR.EMPLOYEES` table, such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE LAST_NAME = 'Smith' AND FIRST_NAME = 'John';
```

### Implementation Details
------------------------

*   The index is created using the `CREATE INDEX` statement.
*   The `NOLOGGING`, `NOCOMPRESS`, and `NOPARALLEL` clauses are used to optimize performance.

```sql
CREATE INDEX HR.EMP_NAME_IX ON HR.EMPLOYEES (LAST_NAME ASC, FIRST_NAME ASC) NOLOGGING NOPARALLEL;
```
