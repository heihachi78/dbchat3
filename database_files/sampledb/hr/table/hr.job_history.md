# HR.JOB_HISTORY (Table)

## Object Overview
The HR.JOB_HISTORY table tracks the historical job roles and departments for employees within the HR schema. It serves as a central repository for recording the timeline of job assignments, including start and end dates, job titles, and departmental affiliations. This table is critical for analyzing employee career trajectories, job tenure, and departmental workforce movements.

## Component Analysis
### Business Meaning & Purpose
- **EMPLOYEE_ID**: Unique identifier for employees; part of a composite primary key to ensure unique job history entries per employee.
- **START_DATE**: Date when an employee began a job role; part of the composite primary key.
- **END_DATE**: Date when an employee left a job role; enforced to be after START_DATE.
- **JOB_ID**: Reference to a specific job title (JOBS table).
- **DEPARTMENT_ID**: Reference to a department (DEPARTMENTS table).

### Data Specifications
- **EMPLOYEE_ID**: 6-digit number, mandatory.
- **START_DATE**: Date type, mandatory.
- **END_DATE**: Date type, mandatory.
- **JOB_ID**: 10-byte string, mandatory.
- **DEPARTMENT_ID**: 4-digit number, optional.

### Validation Rules
- **Date Interval Constraint**: `END_DATE > START_DATE` (enforced by `JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL` check constraint).
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: 
  - `JHIST_EMP_FK`: Links to EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID.
  - `JHIST_JOB_FK`: Links to JOBS.JOB_ID.
  - `JHIST_DEPT_FK`: Links to DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID.
- **Primary Key**: Composite key on (EMPLOYEE_ID, START_DATE).

### Default Values & Significance
- No explicit default values defined in DDL.
- Composite primary key ensures uniqueness of job history entries per employee and date.

### Special Handling
- **Logging**: Enabled (`LOGGING`), ensuring the table is logged for recovery purposes.
- **Constraint Validation**: `JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL` is validated immediately and enabled.

## Complete Relationship Mapping
### Foreign Key Relationships
- **EMPLOYEE_ID** → **EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID** (foreign key).
- **JOB_ID** → **JOBS.JOB_ID** (foreign key).
- **DEPARTMENT_ID** → **DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID** (foreign key).

### Hierarchical & Self-Referencing
- No self-referencing or hierarchical relationships defined.

### Dependencies
- Depends on **EMPLOYEES**, **JOBS**, and **DEPARTMENTS** tables.
- Depends on **JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL** check constraint.

### Objects That Depend On This One
- No direct dependencies identified in the provided DDL.

## Comprehensive Constraints & Rules
### Constraints
1. **JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL** (CHECK): Ensures `END_DATE > START_DATE`.
2. **JHIST_EMP_ID_ST_DATE_PK** (PRIMARY KEY): Composite key on (EMPLOYEE_ID, START_DATE).
3. **JHIST_EMP_FK** (FOREIGN KEY): Links to EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID.
4. **JHIST_JOB_FK** (FOREIGN KEY): Links to JOBS.JOB_ID.
5. **JHIST_DEPT_FK** (FOREIGN KEY): Links to DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID.

### Business Rules
- Each employee can have multiple job history entries, but each job assignment is uniquely identified by (EMPLOYEE_ID, START_DATE).
- Job history entries must have valid dates and reference existing job titles and departments.
- The end date of a job assignment must be after the start date.

### Security & Integrity
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.
- Composite primary key ensures unique job history records.
- Check constraint enforces date validity at the database level.

## Usage Patterns & Integration
### Business Processes
- Tracks employee career progression and job tenure.
- Supports reporting on historical job roles and departmental assignments.
- Used in HR analytics for workforce planning and performance reviews.

### Interaction Patterns
- **Common Queries**: Join with EMPLOYEES, JOBS, and DEPARTMENTS to retrieve employee details, job titles, and departments for historical records.
- **Advanced Use**: Analyze trends in job changes, departmental turnover, or employee mobility.

### Performance Considerations
- Composite primary key on (EMPLOYEE_ID, START_DATE) may impact query performance for range-based searches.
- Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency but may affect write performance.

### Integration Points
- Integrates with HR applications for employee records, job management, and departmental data.
- Used in data warehouses for historical analysis.

## Implementation Details
### Storage & Logging
- **Logging**: Enabled (`LOGGING`) for recovery and auditing.
- **Storage**: Standard table storage with no special settings specified.

### Database Features
- **Check Constraint**: Enforces date validity.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures referential integrity.
- **Composite Primary Key**: Ensures unique job history entries.

### Maintenance
- Regularly validate foreign key relationships to ensure data consistency.
- Monitor for orphaned records (e.g., EMPLOYEE_ID not found in EMPLOYEES).
- Periodically analyze the table for performance optimization, especially for queries involving the composite key.
