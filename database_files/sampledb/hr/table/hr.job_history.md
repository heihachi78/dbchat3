**HR.JOB_HISTORY Object Overview**
=====================================

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table is a critical component of the human resources management system, tracking an employee's job history. It serves as a bridge between the employee and job information, providing insights into career progression and departmental assignments.

**Primary Purpose:**

* To store historical job data for employees
* To facilitate reporting and analysis of employee career paths

**Business Context:**

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table is used to track an employee's job history, including start and end dates, job IDs, and department IDs. This information is essential for understanding an employee's career progression, identifying gaps in employment, and making informed decisions about promotions and terminations.

**Detailed Structure & Components**
------------------------------------

### Columns

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EMPLOYEE_ID | NUMBER(6) | Unique identifier for the employee; foreign key to the EMPLOYEES table |
| START_DATE | DATE | Date of employment start; must be less than the END_DATE |
| END_DATE | DATE | Date of employment end; must be greater than the START_DATE |
| JOB_ID | VARCHAR2(10 BYTE) | Job ID in which the employee worked; foreign key to the JOBS table |
| DEPARTMENT_ID | NUMBER(4) | Department ID in which the employee worked; foreign key to the DEPARTMENTS table |

### Constraints

* **JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL**: Checks that the END_DATE is greater than the START_DATE (INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, ENABLE, VALIDATE)
* **JHIST_EMP_ID_ST_DATE_PK**: Primary key on the EMPLOYEE_ID and START_DATE columns
* **JHIST_DEPT_FK**: Foreign key constraint on the DEPARTMENT_ID column referencing the DEPARTMENTS table
* **JHIST_EMP_FK**: Foreign key constraint on the EMPLOYEE_ID column referencing the EMPLOYEES table
* **JHIST_JOB_FK**: Foreign key constraint on the JOB_ID column referencing the JOBS table

### Comments

The comments provide additional context and explanations for each column, including:

* EMPLOYEE_ID: A not-null column in the complex primary key employee_id+start_date. Foreign key to employee_id column of the employee table
* START_DATE: A not-null column in the complex primary key employee_id+start_date. Must be less than the end_date of the job_history table. (enforced by constraint jhist_date_interval)
* END_DATE: Last day of the employee in this job role. A not-null column. Must be greater than the start_date of the job_history table. (enforced by constraint jhist_date_interval)
* JOB_ID: Job role in which the employee worked in the past; foreign key to job_id column in the jobs table. A not-null column.
* DEPARTMENT_ID: Department id in which the employee worked in the past; foreign key to department_id column in the departments table

**Component Analysis**
----------------------

### Business Meaning and Purpose

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table is designed to capture an employee's job history, including start and end dates, job IDs, and department IDs. This information is essential for understanding an employee's career progression, identifying gaps in employment, and making informed decisions about promotions and terminations.

### Data Type Specifications

* EMPLOYEE_ID: NUMBER(6)
* START_DATE: DATE
* END_DATE: DATE
* JOB_ID: VARCHAR2(10 BYTE)
* DEPARTMENT_ID: NUMBER(4)

### Validation Rules and Constraints

* The JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL constraint ensures that the END_DATE is greater than the START_DATE.
* The JHIST_EMP_ID_ST_DATE_PK primary key constraint ensures that the combination of EMPLOYEE_ID and START_DATE is unique.

**Complete Relationship Mapping**
------------------------------

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table has foreign key relationships with the following tables:

* EMPLOYEES: EMPLOYEE_ID
* DEPARTMENTS: DEPARTMENT_ID
* JOBS: JOB_ID

These relationships enable the tracking of an employee's job history and department assignments.

**Comprehensive Constraints & Rules**
------------------------------------

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table has the following constraints and rules:

* JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL: Checks that the END_DATE is greater than the START_DATE.
* JHIST_EMP_ID_ST_DATE_PK: Primary key on the EMPLOYEE_ID and START_DATE columns.
* JHIST_DEPT_FK: Foreign key constraint on the DEPARTMENT_ID column referencing the DEPARTMENTS table.
* JHIST_EMP_FK: Foreign key constraint on the EMPLOYEE_ID column referencing the EMPLOYEES table.
* JHIST_JOB_FK: Foreign key constraint on the JOB_ID column referencing the JOBS table.

**Usage Patterns & Integration**
-------------------------------

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table is used to support various business processes, including:

* Reporting and analysis of employee career paths
* Identification of gaps in employment
* Promotion and termination decisions

The table integrates with other HR systems, such as the EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, and JOBS tables.

**Implementation Details**
-------------------------

The HR.JOB_HISTORY table is implemented using the following database features:

* Primary key: JHIST_EMP_ID_ST_DATE_PK
* Foreign key constraints: JHIST_DEPT_FK, JHIST_EMP_FK, JHIST_JOB_FK
* Constraints: JHIST_DATE_INTERVAL
