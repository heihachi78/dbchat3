**HR.REGIONS Table Documentation**
=====================================

### Object Overview
-------------------

The `hr.REGIONS` table is a database object that stores information about different regions. It serves as the primary entity for managing regional data in the HR system.

### Detailed Structure & Components
------------------------------------

#### Columns

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REGION_ID | NUMBER | Primary key of regions table. Unique identifier for each region. |

#### Constraints

*   **Primary Key Constraint**: `REG_ID_PK` - Ensures that the `REGION_ID` column is unique and serves as the primary key for the table.

### Component Analysis (Leverage ALL DDL Comments)
-----------------------------------------------

*   **Business Meaning**: The `REGION_ID` column represents a unique identifier for each region, while the `REGION_NAME` column stores the names of regions along with their corresponding locations in countries.
*   **Data Type Specifications**:
    *   `NUMBER`: The data type for `REGION_ID` is `NUMBER`, indicating that it can store integer values.
    *   `VARCHAR2 (25 BYTE)`: The data type for `REGION_NAME` is `VARCHAR2(25 BYTE)`, specifying a fixed-length string with a maximum length of 25 bytes.

### Complete Relationship Mapping
------------------------------

There are no explicit foreign key relationships defined in the `hr.REGIONS` table. However, it's essential to note that this table might be used as a reference point for other tables in the HR system.

### Comprehensive Constraints & Rules
------------------------------------

*   **Primary Key Constraint**: The `REG_ID_PK` constraint ensures that each region has a unique identifier.
*   **Logging**: The `LOGGING` clause is applied to the entire table, which might be used for auditing or logging purposes.

### Usage Patterns & Integration
-------------------------------

The `hr.REGIONS` table is likely used in various HR-related processes, such as:

*   Region-based reporting and analysis
*   Location-based data processing
*   Country-specific data management

### Implementation Details
-------------------------

*   **Storage Specifications**: The `VARCHAR2 (25 BYTE)` column has a fixed length of 25 bytes.
*   **Logging Settings**: The `LOGGING` clause is applied to the entire table, which might be used for auditing or logging purposes.
