# HR.JOBS (Table)

## Object Overview
This table stores job title information with associated salary ranges. It serves as a central repository for job definitions used in the HR system, enabling salary calculations, job classification, and employee role management. The table is designed to support queries related to job titles, salary structures, and job classification hierarchies.

## Detailed Structure & Components
**Columns:**
- **JOB_ID** (VARCHAR2(10 BYTE)): Primary key identifier for job titles
- **JOB_TITLE** (VARCHAR2(35 BYTE)): Job title description (e.g. AD_VP, FI_ACCOUNTANT)
- **MIN_SALARY** (NUMBER(6)): Minimum salary for the job title
- **MAX_SALARY** (NUMBER(6)): Maximum salary for the job title

**Table Attributes:**
- LOGGING: Enabled for recovery and auditing purposes

## Component Analysis
### Business Meaning
- **JOB_ID**: Unique identifier for job titles (primary key)
- **JOB_TITLE**: Human-readable job title with standardized abbreviations
- **MIN_SALARY**: Minimum salary range for the job title
- **MAX_SALARY**: Maximum salary range for the job title

### Data Specifications
- JOB_ID: 10-byte VARCHAR2, NOT NULL
- JOB_TITLE: 35-byte VARCHAR2, NOT NULL
- MIN_SALARY: 6-digit numeric value (precision 6)
- MAX_SALARY: 6-digit numeric value (precision 6)

### Constraints
- **JOB_ID**: NOT NULL (primary key constraint)
- **JOB_TITLE**: NOT NULL (business rule)
- **MIN_SALARY**: No explicit constraint (but likely requires non-negative values)
- **MAX_SALARY**: No explicit constraint (but likely requires non-negative values)

### Special Handling
- Primary key constraint explicitly defined via ALTER TABLE
- LOGGING enabled for audit trails and recovery

## Complete Relationship Mapping
- **No direct foreign keys** defined in this table
- **Dependent objects**: Likely referenced by EMPLOYEES table (foreign key relationship)
- **Independent objects**: Standalone table with no dependencies
- **Impact analysis**: Changes to job titles or salary ranges would affect employee records

## Comprehensive Constraints & Rules
- **Primary Key Constraint**: JOB_ID_PK ensures unique job identifiers
- **NOT NULL Constraints**: 
  - JOB_ID (primary key requirement)
  - JOB_TITLE (mandatory job title definition)
- **Data Integrity**: 
  - Salary values must be non-negative (implied business rule)
  - JOB_ID must be unique across the table
- **Security**: No explicit access controls defined
- **Performance**: LOGGING enables recovery but may impact write performance

## Usage Patterns & Integration
- **Common Use Cases**: 
  - Retrieving job titles and salary ranges
  - Calculating salary ranges for new hires
  - Job classification for employee records
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Linked to EMPLOYEES table via foreign key (JOB_ID)
  - Used in salary calculation workflows
  - Referenced in job classification reports
- **Performance Considerations**: 
  - LOGGING may increase disk usage
  - Index on JOB_ID (primary key) ensures fast lookups

## Implementation Details
- **Storage**: VARCHAR2(10) for JOB_ID (10 bytes), VARCHAR2(35) for JOB_TITLE (35 bytes)
- **Logging**: Enabled for audit trails and recovery
- **Maintenance**: 
  - Regular checks for duplicate JOB_IDs
  - Salary range validation during data entry
  - Periodic review of salary ranges for accuracy

This table provides the foundational data structure for managing job definitions and salary ranges in the HR system, with strict constraints to ensure data integrity and business accuracy.
