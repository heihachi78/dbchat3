# HR.COUNTRIES (Table)

## Object Overview
The HR.COUNTRIES table stores country-related data for the Human Resources department. It serves as a central repository for country identifiers, names, and regional associations. This table is critical for applications that require geographical or administrative data, such as employee location tracking, regional reporting, or international compliance management.

## Detailed Structure & Components
**Columns:**
1. **COUNTRY_ID**  
   - Type: CHAR(2 BYTE)  
   - Constraint: NOT NULL  
   - Purpose: Primary key identifying a country  

2. **COUNTRY_NAME**  
   - Type: VARCHAR2(40 BYTE)  
   - Purpose: Name of the country  

3. **REGION_ID**  
   - Type: NUMBER  
   - Purpose: Foreign key referencing the REGION_ID in the REGIONS table  

## Component Analysis
- **COUNTRY_ID**:  
  - **Business Meaning**: Unique identifier for a country (e.g., "US", "CA").  
  - **Data Type**: 2-byte character, ensuring compact storage.  
  - **Constraints**: Mandatory (NOT NULL), uniquely identifies rows.  
  - **Default**: Not specified, as it is a primary key.  

- **COUNTRY_NAME**:  
  - **Business Meaning**: Human-readable name of the country.  
  - **Data Type**: 40-byte variable-length string, accommodating common country names.  
  - **Constraints**: Optional (NULL allowed).  

- **REGION_ID**:  
  - **Business Meaning**: Links a country to a region (e.g., "North America").  
  - **Data Type**: 64-bit integer, suitable for regional identifiers.  
  - **Constraints**: Foreign key to REGIONS.REGION_ID.  

## Complete Relationship Mapping
- **Foreign Key**: REGION_ID â†’ REFERENCES HR.REGIONS.REGION_ID  
  - **Purpose**: Establishes a many-to-one relationship between countries and regions.  
  - **Impact**: Ensures a country belongs to a valid region.  

- **Primary Key**: COUNTRY_ID  
  - **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies each country record.  

- **Dependencies**:  
  - This table depends on the HR.REGIONS table for REGION_ID values.  

- **Dependents**:  
  - Tables or views that reference this table (e.g., HR.EMPLOYEES, HR.DEPARTMENTS) may depend on it.  

## Comprehensive Constraints & Rules
- **Primary Key Constraint (COUNTRY_C_ID_PK)**:  
  - Ensures COUNTRY_ID is unique and non-null.  
  - Enforced at the database level to maintain data integrity.  

- **Foreign Key Constraint (COUNTR_REG_FK)**:  
  - Ensures REGION_ID exists in the REGIONS table.  
  - Not deferrable, meaning constraints are enforced immediately.  

- **Logging**:  
  - The table is LOGGING-enabled, meaning changes are logged for auditability.  

## Usage Patterns & Integration
- **Common Use Cases**:  
  - Retrieving country details for employee location data.  
  - Filtering data by region (e.g., "All countries in Europe").  

- **Integration**:  
  - Joined with HR.REGIONS for regional analysis.  
  - Used in queries to validate country-region relationships.  

- **Performance**:  
  - The primary key index on COUNTRY_ID ensures fast lookups.  
  - The foreign key index on REGION_ID optimizes joins with the REGIONS table.  

## Implementation Details
- **Storage**:  
  - COUNTRY_ID: 2-byte CHAR, minimizing storage.  
  - COUNTRY_NAME: 40-byte VARCHAR2, allowing flexibility.  
  - REGION_ID: 64-bit NUMBER, suitable for regional identifiers.  

- **Logging**:  
  - All DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are logged.  

- **Maintenance**:  
  - Regular checks on foreign key constraints to ensure data consistency.  
  - Indexes on COUNTRY_ID and REGION_ID are critical for performance.
