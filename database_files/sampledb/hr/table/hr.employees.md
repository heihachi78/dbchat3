## Component Analysis

- **EMPLOYEE_ID:**  
  - Data type precision: NUMBER with 6 digits, no decimals.  
  - Not nullable, serves as primary key.  
  - Business significance: Unique employee identifier for all HR operations.

- **FIRST_NAME:**  
  - VARCHAR2 with max 20 bytes.  
  - Comment states NOT NULL, but DDL allows NULL (potential inconsistency).  
  - Represents employee's given name.

- **LAST_NAME:**  
  - VARCHAR2 with max 25 bytes.  
  - Not nullable, mandatory for identification.

- **EMAIL:**  
  - VARCHAR2 with max 25 bytes.  
  - Not nullable and unique (enforced by unique constraint `EMP_EMAIL_UK`).  
  - Used for communication and login identification.

- **PHONE_NUMBER:**  
  - VARCHAR2 with max 20 bytes.  
  - Optional field including country and area codes.

- **HIRE_DATE:**  
  - DATE type, not nullable.  
  - Marks employee's start date in the company.

- **JOB_ID:**  
  - VARCHAR2 with max 10 bytes, not nullable.  
  - Foreign key to `JOBS.JOB_ID`.  
  - Represents current job role of the employee.

- **SALARY:**  
  - NUMBER with precision 8 and scale 2 (e.g., up to 999,999.99).  
  - Optional but must be greater than zero if provided (enforced by constraint `emp_salary_min`).  
  - Represents monthly salary.

- **COMMISSION_PCT:**  
  - NUMBER(2,2) meaning max 0.99 (percentage as decimal).  
  - Default value 0.00.  
  - Only applicable to sales department employees.

- **MANAGER_ID:**  
  - NUMBER(6), optional.  
  - Foreign key referencing `EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID` (self-referential).  
  - Supports hierarchical management structure and recursive queries (e.g., CONNECT BY).

- **DEPARTMENT_ID:**  
  - NUMBER(4), optional.  
  - Foreign key to `DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID`.  
  - Indicates employee's department assignment.

## Complete Relationship Mapping

- **Primary Key:**  
  - `EMP_EMP_ID_PK` on `EMPLOYEE_ID`.

- **Unique Constraints:**  
  - `EMP_EMAIL_UK` on `EMAIL` ensures no duplicate email addresses.

- **Foreign Keys:**  
  - `EMP_DEPT_FK`: `DEPARTMENT_ID` → `DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID`  
    - Links employee to their department.  
  - `EMP_JOB_FK`: `JOB_ID` → `JOBS.JOB_ID`  
    - Associates employee with their job role.  
  - `EMP_MANAGER_FK`: `MANAGER_ID` → `EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID`  
    - Self-referential link to manager, enabling hierarchical queries and organizational charts.

- **Hierarchical Structure:**  
  - `MANAGER_ID` creates a tree-like structure of employees reporting to managers.  
  - Enables recursive queries (e.g., CONNECT BY) for organizational hierarchy.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - Depends on `JOBS` and `DEPARTMENTS` tables for job and department references.  
  - Other objects (e.g., payroll, attendance) likely depend on `EMPLOYEES`.

- **Impact of Changes:**  
  - Modifying `EMPLOYEE_ID` affects all referencing foreign keys, including self-references.  
  - Changes to `JOB_ID` or `DEPARTMENT_ID` require consistency with referenced tables.  
  - Deleting a manager requires handling dependent employees' `MANAGER_ID` values.

## Comprehensive Constraints & Rules

- **Primary Key Constraint:**  
  - Ensures uniqueness and non-nullability of `EMPLOYEE_ID`.

- **Unique Constraint on EMAIL:**  
  - Enforces unique email addresses for employee identification and communication.

- **Foreign Key Constraints:**  
  - Enforce referential integrity with `JOBS`, `DEPARTMENTS`, and self (`EMPLOYEES`).

- **Salary Validation:**  
  - Constraint `emp_salary_min` (not shown in DDL but referenced) enforces salary > 0.

- **Default Values:**  
  - `COMMISSION_PCT` defaults to 0.00, reflecting no commission unless specified.

- **Nullability:**  
  - Mandatory fields: `EMPLOYEE_ID`, `LAST_NAME`, `EMAIL`, `HIRE_DATE`, `JOB_ID`.  
  - Optional fields: `FIRST_NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `SALARY`, `COMMISSION_PCT`, `MANAGER_ID`, `DEPARTMENT_ID`.

- **Security & Data Integrity:**  
  - Constraints ensure valid, consistent employee data.  
  - Unique email supports secure user identification.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  - Primary key and unique constraints support efficient lookups.  
  - Foreign keys enable optimized joins with related tables.

## Usage Patterns & Integration

- **Business Processes:**  
  - Employee onboarding and HR management.  
  - Payroll and compensation calculations.  
  - Organizational hierarchy and reporting structures.  
  - Departmental assignments and job role tracking.

- **Common Queries:**  
  - Retrieve employee details by ID, email, or department.  
  - Hierarchical queries to find managers and subordinates.  
  - Salary and commission reports.  
  - Job and department-based employee listings.

- **Integration Points:**  
  - Linked with `JOBS` and `DEPARTMENTS` tables for role and location context.  
  - Used by payroll, attendance, performance management, and recruitment systems.

- **Performance Tuning:**  
  - Indexes on primary key and unique email support fast lookups.  
  - Foreign keys facilitate join optimizations.

## Implementation Details

- **Storage:**  
  - Table created with `LOGGING` enabled, ensuring changes are logged for recovery and auditing.

- **Special Features:**  
  - Self-referential foreign key on `MANAGER_ID` supports hierarchical queries using Oracle's CONNECT BY syntax.

- **Maintenance:**  
  - Regular monitoring of constraints and indexes recommended.  
  - Updates to employee-manager relationships require careful handling to maintain hierarchy integrity.
